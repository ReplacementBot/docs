# Introduction

### About

Meet the ReplacementBot a Discord bot made to make your school life easier. The Bot automatically fetches substitutions from your school website and shows them right on your discord server.

### Invite The Bot to your server

Unfortunately, the current version of the bot doesn't allow for us to host one public version. A Couple of things hold us back but we are working hard to bring the bot to the state where it can work with multiple servers. As of now please read self-hosting section below. We made a very beginner-friendly non-technical guide using free services to help you setup bot by yourself.
