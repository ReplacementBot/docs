# What is ReplacementBot

**ReplacementBot** is a feature-rich discord bot to fetch, parse, and display school substitutions right on your discord server!

## Meet the ReplacementBot

* ðŸ§© **Integrate with everything** that is online. ReplacementBot supports an ever-expanding base of fetchers. You can always create fetcher and submit it to the bot!

### Invite The Bot to your server

Unfortunately, the current version of the bot doesn't allow for us to host one public version. A Couple of things hold us back but we are working hard to bring the bot to the state where it can work with multiple servers. As of now please read self-hosting section below. We made a very beginner-friendly non-technical guide using free services to help you setup bot by yourself.
